### Aim of the experiment

1. To implement and visualize the Divide and Conquer algorithm for finding the closest pair of points in a two-dimensional plane, and observe the step-by-step process of spatial decomposition, recursive subdivision, and strip-based comparison on randomly generated point sets.

2. To analyze and compare the algorithm’s efficiency under best-case and worst-case scenarios in terms of execution time, number of distance computations, and scalability, and to highlight the limitations of the brute force approach for large input sizes.
