### Aim of the Experiment

1. To implement and visualize Divide and Conquer based sorting algorithms: Merge Sort and Quick Sort, and observe their step-by-step process of problem decomposition and merging/partitioning on randomly generated input lists.


2. To analyze and compare their efficiency in terms of time complexity, number of comparisons performed, and scalability with increasing input size.
