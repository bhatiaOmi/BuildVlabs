        "a": "Quick Sort division depends on pivot selection.",

      "question": "In Quick Sort using the Median of Three approach, the pivot is selected as the median of which elements?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "First, second, and last",
        "b": "First, middle, and last",
        "c": "Middle three elements",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Only one of these represents a good pivot selection strategy.",
        "b": "Median of first, middle, and last helps avoid worst-case partitions.",
        "c": "The algorithm does not choose three middle elements.",

    {
      "question": "Why does the Median of Three technique improve Quick Sort performance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reduces recursion depth",
        "b": "It avoids selecting extreme pivot values",
        "c": "It eliminates swapping",
        "d": "It removes recursion"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Recursion depth may reduce indirectly but this is not the main reason.",
        "b": "Choosing a balanced pivot avoids highly unbalanced partitions.",
        "c": "Swapping is still required.",
        "d": "Quick Sort always uses recursion."

      "question": "After completing the simulation, what can be concluded about Merge Sort and Quick Sort?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Both always perform in O(n²) time",
        "b": "Merge Sort is in-place and Quick Sort uses extra memory",
        "c": "Merge Sort has consistent performance, while Quick Sort depends on pivot selection",
        "d": "Quick Sort cannot sort large arrays"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Both algorithms are more efficient than O(n²) in most cases.",
        "b": "Merge Sort uses extra memory, not Quick Sort.",
        "c": "Merge Sort performance is consistent, while Quick Sort varies with pivot choice.",
        "d": "Quick Sort can efficiently sort large arrays."
