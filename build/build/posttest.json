      "explanations": {
        "a": "Quick Sort division depends on pivot selection and may be unbalanced.",
        "b": "Merge Sort always splits the array into two equal or nearly equal halves.",
        "c": "Bubble Sort does not divide the array.",

      "question": "In Merge Sort, the array is recursively divided until each subarray contains:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Two elements",

        "c": "One element",

        "a": "Division continues beyond two elements.",
        "b": "Merge Sort does not stop at three elements.",

      "question": "In Quick Sort using the Median of Three approach, the pivot is selected as the median of which elements?",

        "a": "First, second, and last",
        "b": "First, middle, and last",
        "c": "Middle three elements",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The second element is not part of the Median-of-Three method.",
        "b": "Median of first, middle, and last helps avoid worst-case partitions.",
        "c": "The algorithm does not choose three middle elements.",

    {
      "question": "Why does the Median of Three technique improve Quick Sort performance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reduces recursion depth",
        "b": "It avoids selecting extreme pivot values",
        "c": "It eliminates swapping",
        "d": "It removes recursion"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Reduced recursion depth is a result, not the main goal.",
        "b": "Balanced pivot selection prevents highly unbalanced partitions.",
        "c": "Swapping is still required in Quick Sort.",
        "d": "Quick Sort always uses recursion."

    {
      "question": "In the Median-of-Three technique, once arr[left] ≤ arr[center] ≤ arr[right] is ensured, where is the median element usually moved in the array?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At the first index (left)",
        "b": "At the middle index",
        "c": "At the second last index (right − 1)",
        "d": "At the last index (right)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The first index is not used as the pivot position.",
        "b": "The median is not kept in the middle for partitioning.",
        "c": "The median is moved to right − 1 to act as the pivot during partitioning.",
        "d": "The last index is reserved as a boundary element."
