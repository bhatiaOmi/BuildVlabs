      "question": "Which of the following best describes the divide and conquer technique?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Solving a problem by trying all possible solutions",
        "b": "Dividing a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving them, and combining the results",

        "d": "Sorting elements by comparing adjacent values"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This describes brute-force techniques, not divide and conquer.",
        "b": "Divide and conquer works by breaking a problem into smaller parts, solving them recursively, and combining results.",
        "c": "Iterative approaches use loops rather than recursion.",
        "d": "This describes bubble sort, not the divide and conquer paradigm."

      "question": "What is the primary reason for using sorting algorithms in computer science?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce memory usage",
        "b": "To improve data security",
        "c": "To organize data for efficient searching and processing",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Sorting may increase memory usage depending on the algorithm.",
        "b": "Sorting does not directly improve security.",

      "question": "Which of the following statements about Merge Sort is TRUE?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is an in-place sorting algorithm",
        "b": "Its performance depends on input order",

        "a": "Merge Sort requires additional memory.",
        "b": "Merge Sort performance is independent of input order.",

      "question": "In Quick Sort, what is the role of the pivot element?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It stores the final sorted array",
        "b": "It divides the array into two subarrays based on comparison",
        "c": "It determines the size of the input array",
        "d": "It is always the smallest element"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The pivot does not store the sorted array.",
        "b": "The pivot partitions the array into elements smaller and larger than itself.",
        "c": "Array size is independent of the pivot.",
        "d": "The pivot can be any element depending on selection strategy."
