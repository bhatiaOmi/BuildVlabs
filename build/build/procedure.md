### Procedure
#### 3.1 User Input:
1. Select the desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu:
    Merge Sort
    Quick Sort 
2. Adjust the value of N (number of elements in the array) using the slider provided.
3. Select the type of input array from the dropdown menu:
    Randomly generated array
    Already sorted array (ascending order)
    Already sorted array (descending order)
4. Click the “Run Simulation” button to generate the input array and initialize the    selected sorting algorithm.

#### 3.2 Calculations / Simulation Steps

1. Click the “Next” button to execute the sorting algorithm step-by-step.
2. Observe the comparison, movement, and placement of elements at each step of the algorithm.
3. During Merge Sort execution, observe the following:
   Recursive splitting of the array into smaller subarrays
   Merging of subarrays in sorted order by comparing elements
4. During Quick Sort (Median of Three) execution, observe the following:
5. Selection of pivot using the Median-of-Three method
    Movement of pointer P from left to right
    Movement of pointer Q from right to left
6. Swapping of elements when pointers identify misplaced values
7. Placement of the pivot element at its correct sorted position after pointer crossing
8. Click the “Previous” button to revisit earlier steps and analyze the algorithm’s behavior in detail.
9. Click the “Auto-Run” button to automatically execute all remaining steps until the sorting process is completed.

### 3.3 Results
1. Observe the Final Sorted Array displayed in the result section after completion of the simulation.
2. Analyze the Step Log, which records every operation performed by the algorithm along with the corresponding array state.
3. Observe and compare the following parameters:
    Number of comparisons performed
    Number of swaps made
    Recursive behavior of the algorithms
    Performance on different input arrangements
4. Study the Facts & Analysis section to understand:
    Time complexity of the algorithms
    Space complexity of the algorithms
    Advantages of Median-of-Three pivot selection in Quick Sort
    Key differences between Merge Sort and Quick Sort
